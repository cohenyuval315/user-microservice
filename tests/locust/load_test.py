# Load Testing:
# Load testing measures how the system handles expected levels of concurrent users.

# Goal: Ensure the system can handle projected usage levels.
# How to Implement:
# Simulate real-world traffic loads with bursts of activity and idle times.
# Test the system with different numbers of concurrent users (e.g., starting from a baseline and increasing gradually).
