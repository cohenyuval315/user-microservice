# Endurance (Soak) Testing:
# Endurance testing evaluates the system's stability over an extended period (e.g., for memory leaks, database saturation).

# Goal: Ensure the system performs well over long durations of sustained load.
# How to Implement:
# Run tests over several hours or even days.
# Observe the system's performance over time, paying attention to any degradation in response times or throughput.
