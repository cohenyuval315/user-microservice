# Stress Testing:
# Stress tests evaluate how the system performs under extreme load and where its breaking points are.

# Goal: Push the system beyond its capacity to find the limits.
# How to Implement:
# Gradually increase the number of users until the system crashes or performance degrades significantly.
# Focus on finding the point of failure.
