# Baseline Testing:
# This type of test is designed to establish a performance baseline under normal conditions.

# Goal: Determine the system's behavior under a typical load.
# How to Implement:
# Simulate normal traffic (e.g., average users, regular requests).
# Test latency, response times, and throughput.
